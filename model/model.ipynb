    "## Why This Study Exists\n",
    "\n",
    "I was diagnosed with PCOS at the age of **15**.\n",
    "\n",
    "What followed were years of acne flare-ups, hirsutism, irregular menstrual cycles,\n",
    "weight fluctuations, and eventually thyroid imbalance. Treatment plans changed,\n",
    "medications rotated, and explanations often remained incomplete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most clinical tools reduce PCOS to a *binary diagnosis*.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project challenges that.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PCOSense** is built to:\n",
    "- Quantify PCOS risk on a **spectrum**\n",
    "- Combine **clinical data + lived symptoms**\n",
    "- Provide **explainable insights**, not black-box predictions\n",
    "- Act as a **decision-support system**, not a diagnosis\n",
    "\n",
    "> This notebook documents the full research, modeling, and interpretability pipeline.\n"
