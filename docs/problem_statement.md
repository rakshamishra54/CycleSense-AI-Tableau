## Problem Statement

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) affects millions of individuals worldwide, yet it remains underdiagnosed, inconsistently monitored, and poorly understood at a population and operational level. While vast amounts of health, lifestyle, and clinical data exist, organizations lack a unified, trustworthy, and actionable analytics framework to identify risk patterns early and support timely intervention.

Today, most PCOS-related insights live in silos:
- Static reports with no ongoing monitoring
- Disconnected datasets with inconsistent definitions
- No clear indicators of data reliability or freshness
- Limited ability to translate insights into real-world action

As organizations explore AI-powered healthcare analytics, these foundational issues become even more critical. Without trusted data, clear semantics, and measurable readiness, advanced analytics and AI agents risk amplifying noise instead of delivering value.

### Business Impact

The absence of an integrated analytics system results in:
- Delayed identification of high-risk individuals
- Inconsistent monitoring of symptoms and indicators
- Reduced trust in analytical outputs
- Missed opportunities for proactive, data-informed decision-making

Healthcare providers, wellness platforms, and research organizations need a solution that helps them understand **what data they have, how reliable it is, and how it can be used to drive meaningful action** — before layering on advanced AI.

### Proposed Solution

PCOSense is an end-to-end analytics solution built using the Tableau portfolio that transforms raw PCOS-related data into a trusted, action-oriented intelligence system.

The solution leverages:
- Tableau Cloud for centralized analytics and visualization
- A semantic metrics layer to define consistent indicators
- Automated monitoring and alerts to surface risk patterns
- Actionable workflows that connect insights to decision-making

Rather than replacing existing analytics, PCOSense strengthens what organizations already have — enabling readiness for AI-driven and agentic analytics while delivering immediate business value.
